2 - Run "ncat -l -k -v 9090" in terminal B
3 - Run "ncat --proxy-type socks5 -v --proxy 127.0.0.1:1080 ::1 9090" in terminal A

3 terminals are needed for this, terminal A, terminal B and terminal C

1 - Compile and run server on terminal C
2 - Run "curl -o normal.iso http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04.3/ubuntu-18.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso" in terminal B
3 - Calculate checksum of file with "md5sum debian-10.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso > normal.txt" in terminal C
4 - (OPTIONAL) If the server does not have name resolution, you have to resolve the address first with "dig +short cdimage.debian.org"
5 - Run "curl -o proxy.iso -x socks5://localhost:1080 http://91.189.88.153:80/releases/18.04.3/ubuntu-18.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso" in terminal B
6 - Calculate checksum of file with "md5sum debian-10.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso > proxy.txt" in terminal C
7 - Check diff
